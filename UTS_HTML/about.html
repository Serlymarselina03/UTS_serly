                <h2> Serly Marselina </h2>
                <p>Hello! I am Serly Marselina, a 20 year old girl full of enthusiasm and optimism. 
                 Born and raised in Surabaya, Indonesia, I am currently studying at Widya Mandala Catholic University, 
                 majoring in Digital Business Management. Previously, I studied at 
                 Mater Amabilis Vocational School majoring in Tourism. Outside of my busy schedule at college, I have many hobbies that I like, such as cooking, baking, knitting, dancing, and exercising. This hobby has not only brought joy to my life, but has also been an inspiration in starting several small businesses.

                 One example is my hobby of cooking which I often use to open pre-orders for food to friends on campus. 
                 Apart from that, I also make cakes for special occasions such as Chinese New Year, Christmas and Eid. 
                 My creativity doesn't stop there, I also knit cute and trendy hair ties, making them handmade products that are loved by many people.

                 Not only satisfied with offline business, I have also ventured into the online world by opening an online shop that sells household appliances, clothes and various other products. My entrepreneurial spirit and hard work are driven by my extroverted personality and positive vibes.

                I've always enjoyed meeting new people, making friends, and collaborating on projects. For me, life is about continuing to learn, grow, and share happiness with others.

                If you want to get to know me better, don't hesitate to say hello! I am always open to making new friends and sharing stories.
